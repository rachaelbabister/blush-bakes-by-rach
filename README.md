# BLUSH BAKES BY RACH

Welcome to Blush Bakes by Rach - a website for a real business, run by myself. I hadn't created a website for the business so thought it was the perfect opportunity for this first project. 

It has been built in html and css and designed to be responsive across all devices. As a visitor you can view a gallery of previously made cakes which aims to be enticing and encouraging, with a call-to-action to get in touch with the use of a form.

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

Blush Bakes by Rach is run by a local cake artist who would like to have more of an online presence. Although the business has Facebook and Instagram pages, they are aware that not everybody has social media. By having a website it enables the company to be more accessible online to more potential customers.

#### Client Goals

- For potential customers to see the variety of cakes and treat boxes available to order.
- To showcase previously made cakes so that customers can see the style of cakes Blush Bakes by Rach creates.
- To allow visitors to the site to get in touch with Blush Bakes by Rach with an enquiry.
- An informative contact form so that the visitor can fill in as much information as they can on their first contact.
- To be able to see and do all of the above on any device, whether a mobile phone or a desktop computer.

#### First Time Visitor Goals

- I want to see what cakes they have made in the past.
- I want to see what else they do other than cakes.
- I want to get in touch to see if they have availability for my celebration.
- I want to find information easily without too many clicks.
- I want to find out more on their Social Media pages.

#### Returning Visitor Goals

- I want to have another look at the gallery for inspiration.
- I want to follow up my previous viewing of the site to now get in touch with Blush Bakes by Rach.

#### Frequent Visitor Goals

- I want to see the cake I had made on the gallery page.
- I want to recommend Blush Bakes by Rach to friends and family.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme for the website came from the colours that have been used in the logo. The gold was originally a lighter gold, but in order to ensure good visibility against the light background, it was made slightly darker. The idea was to keep the website looking fresh and bright, whilst still easy to read.

### Typography

The fonts used on the website were chosen to contrast each other, with one being a cursive font to closely match the font within the logo, and the other a sans-serif to ensure the main body of the website can be read clearly.

Google Fonts was used to import both fonts:
- Reenie Beenie is the cursive font used on the headings. This uses both a bolder and a lighter font weight.
- Raleway is the sans-serif font used on the main body. It is mainly used in the normal weight, apart from links which are bold.

![Google Fonts used by Blush Bakes by Rach](assets/images/readme-images/googlefonts.png)

Font Awesome is also used for bullet points and the 'back to top' arrow on the website.

### Imagery

The type of imagery used on the website is all photography, with the odd Font Awesome icon appearing as a bullet point. The photos are all originals taken by myself.

### Wireframes

I created Wireframes for mobile, tablet and desktop using Balsamiq.

- [Tablet Wireframe](assets/images/readme-images/tablet-wireframe.png)
- [Desktop Wireframe](assets/images/readme-images/desktop-wireframe.png)

There have been a few minor differences from these Wireframes on the website, mainly due to styling, but I tried to stick as close to them as possible.

## Features

The website contains 4 pages - home page, gallery, contact and a thank you page. Three of these can be accessed via the navigation menu. The thank you page is shown after a visitor has submitted the form on the contact page.

### General features on each page

- All pages show the logo on the left of the page and a responsive navigational bar on the right, in a header at the top of the page. 
- In a footer at the bottom of the page are the social media links for Facebook & Instagram, along with a link to the contact page. These are shown as icons.
- A favicon of the logo appears in the browser tab.
- In the bottom right corner, as you start to scroll down, an arrow appears which enables the user to get back to the top of the page.

#### Home Page

The home page features a bright hero image of some cupcakes and a treat box directly underneath the navigational header. There is some welcome text underneath, which introduces the baker and where they're based.

The next section is broken down into images and text, to showcase some of the cakes and treat boxes, and gives the user ideas as to what they can order and for who.

Just above the footer there is another image banner with a call to action to take you to the contact page.

#### Gallery

In this top section below the menu header, it starts by asking if the user needs inspiration and to take a look at the gallery. There are 3 anchor links (cakes, cupcakes and treat boxes) which when clicked take you to the appropriate part of the gallery.

The same call to action banner is also at the bottom above the footer.

#### Contact

To bring some colour and interest to this page there is a colourful cake banner image below the menu section. It invites users to get in touch using the contact form. Some elements are required before the form can be submitted, and users do get alerted when they haven't filled in these elements.

#### Thank You

A simple page with the same styling as the Contact page. The form elements have been removed and replaced with a 'thank you for submitting' message.

### Future Implementations

- A new page with standard pricing and examples of cakes and their pricing.
- An information page giving users cake care and cutting guides.
- A suppliers page - recommendations of where to buy supplies.
- A 'recipe' page which details flavours available for sponge and fillings, and what options of treat boxes are available.
What features would you like to implement in the future on your site? Would you like to add more pages, or create login functionality? Add these plans here.

### Accessibility

I have tried to ensure the site has been made as accessible as possible by:

- Using semantic HTML.
- Using alt attributes on images where available.
- Adding aria-labels for screen labels.
- Using colour contrasts between the text and background.

## Deployment & Local Development

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Deployment & Local Development section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms#Deployment)

### Deployment

Include instructions here on how to deploy your project. For your first project you will most likely be using GitHub Pages.

### Local Development

The local development section gives instructions on how someone else could make a copy of your project to play with on their local machine. This section will get more complex in the later projects, and can be a great reference to yourself if you forget how to do this.

#### How to Fork

Place instructions on how to fork your project here.

#### How to Clone

Place instructions on how to clone your project here.

## Testing

Start as you mean to go on - and get used to writing a TESTING.md file from the very first project!

Testing requirements aren't massive for your first project, however if you start using a TESTING.md file from your first project you will thank yourself later when completing your later projects, which will contain much more information.
  
Use this part of the README to link to your TESTING.md file - you can view the example TESTING.md file [here](milestone1-testing.md)

## Credits

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Credits section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/BookWorm#Credits)

The Credits section is where you can credit all the people and sources you used throughout your project.

### Code Used

If you have used some code in your project that you didn't write, this is the place to make note of it. Credit the author of the code and if possible a link to where you found the code. You could also add in a brief description of what the code does, or what you are using it for here.

### Content

Who wrote the content for the website? Was it yourself - or have you made the site for someone and they specified what the site was to say? This is the best place to put this information.

### ¬†Media

If you have used any media on your site (images, audio, video etc) you can credit them here. I like to link back to the source where I found the media, and include where on the site the image is used.
  
### ¬†Acknowledgments

If someone helped you out during your project, you can acknowledge them here! For example someone may have taken the time to help you on slack with a problem. Pop a little thank you here with a note of what they helped you with (I like to try and link back to their GitHub or Linked In account too). This is also a great place to thank your mentor and tutor support if you used them.
